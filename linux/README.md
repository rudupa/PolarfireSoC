# Linux Workspace

Linux content complements the Yocto recipes and captures sources that may not belong inside a BitBake layer yet.

- `kernel/` – Patch queues, defconfigs, and helper scripts for Microchip's kernel tree.
- `rootfs/` – Systemd units, configuration overlays, and scripts staged into the image.
- `userspace/` – Standalone apps, HAL libraries, or diagnostic utilities meant to run on Linux U54_0.
