# Userspace Applications

Store accelerator-facing Linux applications here:

- CLI utilities to trigger radar capture or NN inference.
- Telemetry daemons pushing metrics to remote dashboards.
- Python notebooks or scripts used for rapid prototyping.

Document dependencies so Yocto recipes can bundle the required packages.
