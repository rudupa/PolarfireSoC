# Documentation Index

This folder captures architecture notes, AMP planning, and workflow guides for the PolarFire SoC learning project. It complements the code- and build-focused directories at the repository root.

- `architecture/` collects system-level overviews, including AMP partitioning details and radar DSP considerations.
- `workflows/` provides procedural guides (Yocto, Zephyr, HSS deployment, etc.).
- Additional subfolders can be added for benchmarking reports, API references, or onboarding notes.
